# Fix up c2man output for inclusion of examples in the c2man manual page.
# This file gets processed to remove comments because some sed's can't handle
# them. Can you believe it?.

# The double backslashes in variable interpolations are because sed consumes
# one, not because we're defining macros here (we aren't).

# special hack: rename ctype_ex to ctype just to make that example neat.

# replace the .TH line with a title line.
# we only alter the title length just as the title line is output so an example
# that goes over a page break doesn't damage the real manual page's header.
# Also, calculate and remember the shortened line length: groff doesn't reset
# .ll in .SH & .TP macros, so we use an absolute value later rather than
# relative changes.
